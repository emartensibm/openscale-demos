## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
In this demo, we will create a model to determine whether mortgage applications are likely to default. The model is a scikit-learn random forest binary classifier. Upon completion, you will be able to explore OpenScale's fairness, quality, and drift monitors, and demonstrate the explainability service.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
